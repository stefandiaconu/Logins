# Logins

This is an application which stores your personal logins for different accounts.

The user has to create a new account which is stored in keychain access on macOS.
The logins are stored in a csv file in the application folder.

In progress:
  - make it available for Windows and Linux (store user's details on keychain equivalent for Windows and Linux)
  - when an entry is edited, update the table, don't insert new entry
